                  <p>
                    Who did this to me? I go days at a time trying to think of who is to
                     blame. Is it my fault for not knowing better? I'm so ashamed that I
                      let it go on for this long. I blame my parents for not doing
                      enough to prevent a preventable hell. Should their ignorance
                      expell them from any wrong doing? Should I blame my abusers for
                      their depravities of teaching a minor that sex sells or do I
                      blame myself for falling victim? They recked hell making it look
                      heavenly, and me a devoted christan trying to get there. I took
                      comfort in my missory as it made more memories than my happiness.
                      So now pain is where I find peace, I betray myself as a release,
                      thriving for that dopamine rush I got my first time being called
                      sexy. Who should I blame for this rhapsody of self hatred?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What could have possibly been more important than my innocence? You
                    tried to protected me from the outside but it only made me more
                    curious. Instead of teaching me I was left vulnerable to leaches
                    that tainted my ability to trust. I developed lust at such a young
                    age because you failed to gauge my alone time. So now I'm left with
                    open wounds that bled a blind eye for the world to see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I was younger my sanity was split between you two. <br>
                    My pain, you carried. <br>
                    My problems, you solved. <br>
                    Yet my vanity resolves to nothing now. <br>
                    The only thing that is clear is how split you two really were. <br>
                    My suffering as a child a by product. <br>
                    You left me in the wild by myself surrounded by wolves and lions to
                    rip apart my tender flesh. <br>
                    Forcing a soft child to grow rough keloids for tough skin. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Where you dropped me cost my dignity.
                    I learned that abuse is love and love is abuse.
                    Now I'm too scared to love that I let myself be used, and amuse
                    those who demand. I am not the little kid I used to be. Through
                    evolution my environment broke me. So now, growing up as an adult is
                    only teaching me how much of myself I don't know. How much I was
                    told to know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why was it easy for you to turn the other way instead of finding a
                    remedy? I was forgotten in the dust of my old happiness while one of
                     you was off making more. The other I watched do chores just so I
                     could get what I need. The nights I slept wished to bleed were
                     lonely and timid. I basked in the night on the days I didn't want
                     to be awake and had fever dreams in class instead of doing work.
                     The times I showed signs of my troubles they were ignored only to
                     teach me not to expect help. I went into debt expecting a wealth of
                     love and it only taught me how not to. So now how dare you pester
                     me with my lack of calls and cares. I struggle to walk up the
                     stairs of forgiveness and I never know how to let go and take the
                     first step. So don't expect me to forget what I wish I could. <br>
                     When you could have helped, you didn't. By the time you did, I was
                     already too prudent to accept it.
